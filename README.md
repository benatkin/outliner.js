# outliner.js

I'm working on a way to present JSON data, besides serializing it to a string. I'm also trying to build up a corpus of sample JSON documents to make it easy to play around with different presentation styles.

## TODO

* Make API async
* Render bigger objects (CouchOne pages)
* Render multiline in a <pre>
* Add autolink option
* Collapsing and Expanding
* Syntax highlighting post-render example
* load URLs with a spinner
* Edit leaf values
* Add items to objects
* Add items to arrays
* Remove items from objects and arrays
* Wrap a node in a list
* Unwrap node(s) in a list
