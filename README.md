# outliner.js

I'm working on a way to present JSON data, besides serializing it to a string. I'm also trying to build up a corpus of sample JSON documents to make it easy to play around with different presentation styles.

## TODO

* Render with templates
* Collapsing and Expanding
* Rendering string filter for syntax highlighting
* Rendering string filter for links
* Editing leaf values
* Adding items to objects
* Adding itmes to arrays
* Removing itmes from objects and arrays
* Changing types
